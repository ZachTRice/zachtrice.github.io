<p>Temporal coverage: Annual: December 2008 - December 2010; Monthly: December 2008 - November 2011</p>
<p>The Surface Reflectance (NBAR, True Color, Global, Version 3.0) Annual and Monthly layers are a true color composite of images from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite produced by the Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The layer is created from Landsat Band 3, 2, 1 Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR). Version 3 includes atmospheric correction of the reflectance wavelength bands to surface reflectance, normalization of the surface reflectance to nadir view (0 degree view zenith) and a modeled solar zenith angle, and uses an improved  compositing algorithm for retrieving the single best Landsat observation at each pixel location is selected.</p>
<p>These images are called true color or natural color because the combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. These are natural looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.</p>
<p>The sensor resolution is 30 m, the imagery resolution is 31.25 m and the temporal availability is annual for December 2008 - December 2010, where the annual composite is from the preceding year’s December through the current year’s November. For example, for the year 2008, the product includes data from 1 December 2007 through 30 November 2008. For the monthly layer, the temporal availability is December 2008 - November 2011.</p>

<p>The Top of Atmosphere (TOA) Reflectance (True Color, Alaska, Version 1.5) Annual, Seasonal and Monthly layers are a true color composite of images from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite and Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite produced by the Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The layers are created from Landsat Band 3, 2, 1 TOA reflectance. These images are called true color or natural color because the combination of wavelengths is similar to what the human eye would see. These are natural looking images of land surface, oceanic and atmospheric features.</p>
<p>The sensor resolution is 30 m, the imagery resolution is 250 m and the temporal availability for the annual layer is for 2002 - 2011 where the annual composite is from the preceding year’s December through the current year’s November. For example, for the year 2007, the product includes data from December 1, 2006 through November 30, 2007. For the seasonal layer, December 2002 - November 2012 and split into 3 month intervals - December, January, February; March, April, May; June, July, August; September, October, November. For the monthly layer, December 2002 - November 2012.</p>
