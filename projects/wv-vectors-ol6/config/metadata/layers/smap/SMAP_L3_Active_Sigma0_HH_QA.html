<p>The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) "Sigma0 3 km QA (L3, Active, HH Polarization)" layer displays quality assurance (QA) flags for Sigma0 backscatter from the SMAP radar for the horizontal (H) transmit and horizontal (H) receive polarizations.</p>
<p>Within the image, green indicates that Sigma0 observations have acceptable quality for science use, yellow indicates that caution should be used with the Sigma0 observations as one or more quality-impacting conditions have been identified, and red indicates that Sigma0 observations are flagged as bad due to unacceptable quality.</p>
