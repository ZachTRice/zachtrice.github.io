<p>Temporal coverage: January 1980 - Present (most recent complete month)</p>
<p>The monthly surface skin temperature layer is an atmospheric reanalysis product from NASA second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2), produced by the Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) data assimilation system. The layer’s units are in Kelvin (K). The monthly surface skin temperature is time aggregated from corresponding hourly data with spatial resolution of 0.625°×0.5°.</p>
<p>This parameter (TS) was extracted from the product M2TMNXSLV.5.12.4 (Monthly mean, Time-Averaged, Single-Level, Assimilation, Single-Level Diagnostics).</p>
