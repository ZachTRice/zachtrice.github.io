<p>Temporal coverage: 18 June 2002 - 4 October 2011</p>
<p>The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) "Snow Depth Over Ice, 12 km" layer displays snow depth in centimeters over sea ice in the Polar regions from the daily half-orbit passes of the AMSR-E B feedhorn at a 12.5 km resolution. Snow depth over sea ice is a running 5-day average based on the current day and the 4 previous days.</p>
<p>Onboard NASA's Aqua satellite, the AMSR-E radiometer measured terrestrial, oceanic, and atmospheric parameters used to investigate global water and energy cycles. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 12.5 km. The temporal resolution was daily.</p>
